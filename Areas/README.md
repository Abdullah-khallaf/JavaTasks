# Area of shapes application

In this project there are two classes:
  - **Circle** for calculate the area of a circle taking the radius from the user.
  - **Triangle** for calculate the area of a triangle using the perimeter taking the 3 sides from the user.
---
## Main Class
in the main class the context of the program is:
  1. we will take the **radius** from the user.
  2. Create new object of the circle.
  3. Call the calculateArea() and calculateCircumference() 
  4. we will take the three sides of triangle from the user.
  5. Create new object of trinagle.
  6. calling calculateCircumference() and calculateArea() methods and calculate them.

thank you.
