# Find The Max Element Of Array

## About project:
  The project idea is to find the maximum number of an array of elements given by a user.

## How does it work?
  1. First asking the user to enter the number of elements.
  2. Now we will make an array with the needed index.
  3. We will loop on the array to add the elements.
  4. Now We have an array with elements added by user.
  5. Now we will loop on the given array and compare elements of it with the first element to check on the bigger element.
  6. The bigger element will be saved and compared to the next element to set the max element.
  7. Prinitng the Max element.
