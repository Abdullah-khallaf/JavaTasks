# Array Transpose

## About the project:
  Array transpose is an application that swaps the rows and columns of an Array

## How does it works:
  1. First we will take the details of the 2d array from the user (rows, columns and array Elements)
  2. we will initialize the array.
  3. we will apply the transpose function on the array 
  4. transpose will swap between columns and rows values of the matrix and take them as a row and column value.
  5. transpose function will take the data of the swapped matrix.
  6. printing the matrix and swap.
