# Permutation and Combination

## About The Project: 
  Permatuation function is : ![Permatuation Function](https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/permutation.png)
 <br>
Combination function is : ![Combination Function](https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/combination2-600x159.png)

**Now we are going to build app doing these functions**

## How Does It Work?
  1. We will create a class with Ncr and Npr name and hve some methods.
  2. This class will have 3 methods:<br>
          1. fact (that gives us a factorial for a number).</br>
          2. permutation(that takes two values and n and r and apply the permutation function on)</br>
          3. compination(that takes two values and apply the combination function on them)</br>
  3. In the main main function we will create a NcrAndNpr class.
  4. Taking two values from the user n and r.
  5. Apply the NcrAndNpr Methods.
  6. Print the output.
  
Thank you.
